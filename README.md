By analyzing various health indicators (such as age, blood pressure, cholesterol, etc.),the model helps in early detection of potential heart conditions, enabling preventive healthcare interventions

## Tools & Libraries
- Python, Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- Google Colab

###  Applications
- Early disease diagnosis
- Clinical decision support
- Preventive healthcare analytics
